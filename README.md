# On the Go Directions
This Application uses Google Maps Api and Twilio's Api.
To get this to work do the following:
* A server of some sorts, I used ngrok to set up a local server. connect that server to your Twilio 'A message comes in' option.
* Get an Api key and a virtual number from Twilio and use it to fill in the needed areas in main.py













Technologies Used: Python 3, Twilio, Google Maps, flask, ngrok.
Status: In development
